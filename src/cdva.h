@mainpage Documentation

This is the documentation of the C++ classes implementing the MPEG CDVA Experimentation Model (CXM).
The software implements the recommendations contained in the following documents (at http://wg11.sc29.org/):
	- N15338:"Evaluation Framework for Compact Descriptors for Video Analysis - Search and Retrieval", July 2015, Warsaw, Poland
	- N15729:"Evaluation Framework for Compact Descriptors for Video Analysis - Search and Retrieval â€“ Version 2.0", October 2015, Geneva, CH

Documentation on how to build and install the code is contained in the "CDVA_build_run_instructions" document which can be found in the "docs" directory.
