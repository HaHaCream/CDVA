This directory contains a set of tools that rely on proper installation of opencv.
To install it on Ubuntu 16.04 (this will install opencv 2.4.9.1):
	sudo apt install libopencv-dev

To install it on Windows 64 bit:
Download opencv v.2.4.11 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.11/opencv-2.4.11.exe/download
Then run the installation executable (it will unzip the package).
Move the opencv directory to C:\local

From OpenCV documentation:
First we set an enviroment variable to make easier our work. This will hold the build directory of our OpenCV library that we use in our projects. 
Start up a command window as ADMINISTRATOR and enter:

setx -m OPENCV_DIR C:\local\opencv\build\x64\vc10     (suggested for Visual Studio 2010 - 64 bit Windows)
setx -m OPENCV_DIR C:\local\opencv\build\x64\vc11     (suggested for Visual Studio 2011 - 64 bit Windows)
setx -m OPENCV_DIR C:\local\opencv\build\x64\vc12     (suggested for Visual Studio 2012 - 64 bit Windows)

Here the directory is where you have your OpenCV binaries (extracted or built). Inside this you should have two folders called lib and bin. 
The -m should be added if you wish to make the settings computer wise, instead of user wise.

Then set the corresponding binary directory as an additional path (select the correct line):
PATH = %PATH%;C:\local\opencv\build\x64\vc10\bin
PATH = %PATH%;C:\local\opencv\build\x64\vc11\bin
PATH = %PATH%;C:\local\opencv\build\x64\vc12\bin

Then open the ".\build\win\cdva\cdva.sln" solution with Visual Studio, set x64/release and build the project.
